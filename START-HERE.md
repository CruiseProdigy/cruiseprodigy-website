# IMPORTANT - READ FIRST

## What's In This Folder

This is your CruiseProdigy project with a **professional folder structure** already created.

All your files have been **moved to the proper locations**, but they're not quite ready to use yet.

## Current Status

✅ **DONE:**
- Folder structure created
- Files organized into correct folders
- .gitignore file added
- Ready for Git initialization

⚠️ **NOT YET DONE (We'll do together):**
- File paths haven't been updated (links still point to old locations)
- CSS hasn't been extracted into separate files yet
- JavaScript hasn't been extracted yet
- Files haven't been renamed yet

## What This Means

**You CAN:**
- Look at the folder structure
- See where everything lives
- Understand the organization
- Review the files

**You CANNOT (yet):**
- Open index.html and have it work properly (links won't work)
- Use this as your working version (paths need updating first)

## Tomorrow's Session Plan

We will:

1. **Update all file paths** so links work with new structure
2. **Extract common CSS** into css/main.css
3. **Extract JavaScript** into js/ files
4. **Rename files** (remove "line-" prefix from cruise line pages)
5. **Test everything** to make sure it all works
6. **Initialize Git** and make first commit
7. **Push to GitHub** and enable GitHub Pages

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours working together

## What To Do Now

1. **Download this entire folder** to your computer
2. **Keep your original Cruisey_Project folder** as backup (don't delete it!)
3. **Review the new structure** - look around, see how things are organized
4. **Read the README.md** file for full structure documentation
5. **Come back tomorrow** ready to update paths and make it all work

## Important Note

**This folder structure is 100% correct** - it's exactly how professional developers organize web projects.

The files just need their internal links updated to work with the new structure. That's what we'll tackle together tomorrow.

Think of it like: 
- ✅ The filing cabinet is built and organized
- ⏳ We just need to update the reference numbers on each file

## Questions Before Tomorrow?

Feel free to ask anything about:
- Why folders are organized this way
- What goes where
- What we'll be doing tomorrow
- Any concerns you have

Otherwise, see you tomorrow when we make all the links work! 🚀
